# DReaMS

DReaMS is a collaborative initiative to improve research software practices in academic medical centers.

## Mission Statement

D3MRS is the research software management community of Dutch UMCs. It aims to identify shared challenges, collaborate on solutions, and exchange knowledge. Operating at the intersection of institutions and (inter)national organizations, we hope to provide an entry point for decentral research software engineers while also providing a collective voice for engaging with supra-institutional initiatives.
